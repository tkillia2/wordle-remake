# wordle-remake
Attempt to recreate the Wordle game popularized early 2022 for more chances to play it as opposed to once a day. 
Wordle.py is kind of a mismatch of possible ways of doing it while new_wordle.py is a more concise and clear output for the game. 
More refinements may come but it is playable.
Coud=ld potentially add colorama library for words to output for similar to true wordle output


ISSUES:
says double letters automatically
no checking for legit word input 
output spells word in order for correct and in word output lines

JAMES, run these 3 to add something: 

TO ADD --> git add --all (will add all files) otherwise git add [file]

TO COMMIt --> git commit -m "[what it is/does]"

TO PUSH --> git push 

to "rebase" get any updates from me run:

git pull --rebase

* I am not going to make branches cause I find them annoying for this
